# MyCmd

Tool for writing and running commands from a command directory

## Inspiration and Similar Projects

* After reading Ian Henry's post, [sd: my script directory](https://ianthehenry.com/posts/sd-my-script-directory/), and realizing the haphazard way I was throwing together scripts at work, I saw that a similar approach could work for me, giving me reuse for common tasks. It has indeed made my life a lot better. My `mycmd` user directory at work is now **TODO**
