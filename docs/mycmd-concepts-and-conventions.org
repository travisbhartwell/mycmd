** Naming

- When referring to the names of Command Groups or Commands, use the variable name =name=, unless the function refers to both a command group and a command at the same time. In that case, use =command_group_name= and =command_name=.

- When referring to a fully qualified name follow the same pattern, but using the name =fully_qualified_name=, with similar exceptions.
