#+title: Mycmd Planning

* Milestones
** MVP

This will be when I first merge the =rewrite= branch into =main=. Some of the work, such as getting CI integrated will have to happen post =main= merge, so the first MVP is not going to be the initial release. Basically, the done signal will be that I can switch my personal MyCmd install to use this commit.

*** MyCmd Registry Implementation
**** DONE Create =registry-test=
**** DONE Copy discovery functions to =mycmd-registry-lib=

**** DONE =mycmd.command_help=
**** DONE =mycmd.command_version=

* Side Quests
** =bashdoc=

Build [[https://github.com/travisbhartwell/bashdoc][bashdoc]] to generate API docs for the public APIs that MyCmd command group and command writers will use.

** Internal Dependency Analysis and Linting

Write tools to analysis the dependencies between the different MyCmd support libraries to:
- minimize the functions to just those needed
- each support library only loads the libraries it needs
- there are no circular dependencies

This could include:
- a linter
- visualization of dependencies with graphviz
- call graphs

** General Linters

I should establish strict naming conventions for functions and variables and then implement linters to ensure that I keep to those standards.

Also, I should see if there are ways to instrument this to make sure I am not accidentally leaking local variables anywhere.

* Ideas
** Are there diagrams I can create about MyCmd's structure that would help?

* Bugs
** TODO =project.find_files_for_filset= should be additive
** DONE Command group loading needs to set environment variables

* Tasks
** TODO Fix =myproject= filesets to handle non-shell files
** TODO Add MyCmd to [[https://github.com/oils-for-unix/oils/wiki/The-Biggest-Shell-Programs-in-the-World][The Biggest Shell Programs in the World]] when 0.1 is released

* Development Log Entries
** DONE Why Bash?
** TODO 0.1 Release Announcement
** TODO Higher Order Functions in Bash
** TODO Pseudo-structs
** TODO Safety Guarantees in MyCmd
** TODO How MyCmd commands are executed
** TODO How I use git worktrees in development
** TODO Profiling Shell Script Execution
** TODO Testing
** TODO Output Capture and Logging
** TODO General feature discussions
