# December Adventure 2024: Day 30

I had insomnia and didn't sleep well last night, and had a couple of doctor appointments today, so I didn't get much done.

## MyProject

I pushed [a small commit](https://github.com/travisbhartwell/myproject/commit/8e7c60bb198a52cd9c3ba5e3d5bcbced65f437db) adding a bit more detail to the MyProject `README`.

Tomorrow I will have the time and energy to focus on my next step, designing how I can have `myproject` directories out of the source tree of their projects, for when I am adding personal automation to work and other projects that I don't want to commit the MyProject files to.

## MyCmd Completion

I had a brief conversation on Discord today with [Jeff Dickey](https://jdx.dev) about his project [usage](https://usage.jdx.dev). I am going to consider using it for generating command line completion support for MyCmd. Or, at the very least, I can use it to generate examples to figure out how I want to implement completion in MyCmd.
