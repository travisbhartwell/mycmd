# December Adventure 2024: Day 2

Today, I finished a draft of a development log entry that I've been meaning to write: [Why Bash?](../2024-12-02-why-bash), discussing why I have chosen to implement my project [MyCmd](https://github.com/travisbhartwell/mycmd/) in Bash, including my motivations, some potential alternatives, and the pitfalls.

## Other Things

I haven't had time to do much more today. However, ideas bouncing around in my head that I started researching:
* I want to explore writing tools in [Janet](https://janet-lang.org) to see how the language feels to use.
* I started at looking the requirements for implement a new major mode in Emacs.
