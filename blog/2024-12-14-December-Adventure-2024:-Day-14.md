# December Adventure 2024: Day 14

## MyCmd Registry Implementation

I made decent incremental progress on the MyCmd Registry implementation today. Being able to write tests at the same time is so helpful for me.

* [commit aa0536b0c12e62e83c920374457b09e6b6b14e53](https://github.com/travisbhartwell/mycmd/commit/aa0536b0c12e62e83c920374457b09e6b6b14e53): Minimize `mycmd-registry-lib` to a skeleton, so I can incrementally add tested code.
* [commit 3125dad7b06ed37dbe03b017d04c1f34ae7c0c2c](https://github.com/travisbhartwell/mycmd/commit/3125dad7b06ed37dbe03b017d04c1f34ae7c0c2c): Slight detour to fix my test execution functions.
* [commit fef449bee19c539954a0d9bdf1f816f46e053146](https://github.com/travisbhartwell/mycmd/commit/fef449bee19c539954a0d9bdf1f816f46e053146): Copy the discovery functions to `mycmd-registry-lib` and put in test stubs.
* [commit b3ac83020df5daee5b79a560445fe2d37c6b583c](https://github.com/travisbhartwell/mycmd/commit/b3ac83020df5daee5b79a560445fe2d37c6b583c): Implement `mycmd:registry.register_command`.

This feels pretty good. I should be able to copy over the stuff for the Command Group basic registration tomorrow. Step by step I'll get through it.
