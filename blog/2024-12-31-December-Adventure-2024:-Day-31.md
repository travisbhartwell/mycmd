# December Adventure 2024: Day 31

The last day of December Adventure 2024!

## MyProject

I took some time to freewrite about the implementation of how I will locate the MyProject Task definition directories. After this exercise, I pushed [the following commit](https://github.com/travisbhartwell/myproject/commit/552f1db586e69bc195eacc2c0b9bd4cefa6c29f7) with the design for this feature written out in the [design document](https://github.com/travisbhartwell/myproject/blob/552f1db586e69bc195eacc2c0b9bd4cefa6c29f7/docs/myproject-design.org?plain=1) and a series of incremental steps in the [planning document](https://github.com/travisbhartwell/myproject/blame/552f1db586e69bc195eacc2c0b9bd4cefa6c29f7/docs/myproject-planning.org?plain=1).

The design will eventually require some platform-specific support in MyCmd core. I have pushed [this commit](https://github.com/travisbhartwell/mycmd/commit/88040871bd858b1854112450c473d32aad1387cf) with additions to the [planning document](https://github.com/travisbhartwell/mycmd/blob/88040871bd858b1854112450c473d32aad1387cf/docs/mycmd-planning.org?plain=1) with tasks to add support for user config and cache directories.
