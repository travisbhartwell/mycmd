# December Adventure 2024: Day 11

## MyCmd Registry Implementation

I started implementing the MyCmd Registry today. I pushed a work-in-progress commit, [commit a6a44e30a9d81c5036559843c5cb306d311f6db4](https://github.com/travisbhartwell/mycmd/commit/a6a44e30a9d81c5036559843c5cb306d311f6db4), with the changes that I started with. I will continue with this tomorrow. The experiments of the last few days have informed my implementation plans.

## Nix Emacs

Back in 2016, when I was a Nix OS user, I created [nix-emacs](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-emacs/) to offer completion for Nix OS configuration options within Emacs. I have not actively maintained this in many years as I no longer actively use Nix OS. Because of this, I have moved the repository to the [nix-community GitHub organization](https://github.com/nix-community/) in hopes that active Nix OS users can maintain it. If you are part of the Nix community and want to contribute, please reach out.

Since I am still defacto maintainer of the project, I had [a GitHub issue](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-emacs/issues/62) to respond to asking about the license of the code. I had failed to explicitly add a license when I was developing the package originally. I created [pull request 63](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-emacs/pull/63) to add a MIT license to the project and added the other most frequent contributors as reviewers as best effort to have consensus on licensing.

## 2024 GitHub Contributions Skyline

Github [recently released](https://github.blog/changelog/2024-12-09-github-skyline-cli-extension/) a plugin for the `gh` tool to generate a skyline for your code contributions.

Kind of a fun visualization for the year.

## Good Data Visualization

I watched the video "that bad challenger graph, or: how to not suck at data visualization" from the Youtube channel, Dr. Fatima.

Data visualization is an important skill. I am a big proponent of observability and dashboards, so it had some good tips and ideas, well worth a watch.

## Music: BabyMetal

I've become a BabyMetal fan this year and was sad that they didn't come anywhere near me in their US tour this year. However, they made a movie of one of their final shows in Japan and it's in theatres tonight and I'm excited to go see it.
