# December Adventure 2024: Day 25

I took it easy today, only doing a couple small things. The rest of the day was talking with family, exercising, watching the Doctor Who Christmas special, and playing video games.

## MyCmd

I cleaned up the old branches in the [mycmd repo](https://github.com/travisbhartwell/mycmd), leaving just `main` and then the `work-log` branch.

## MyCmd Project Task Runner

I did some clean up of the [meta myproject file](https://gist.github.com/travisbhartwell/809154915ab8ac4d8f8e3c855bc8b5f7), adding a new task to catalog all of the task names across all of my files. I added a task to count the number of tasks defined in each:

```
     214 total
      42 task-lists/main
      29 task-lists/life-dashboard
      24 task-lists/bashdoc
      22 task-lists/dialysistracker
      16 task-lists/work-log
      13 task-lists/financial-data
      12 task-lists/travisbhartwell.github.io
      10 task-lists/financial-importer
      10 task-lists/aspirations
       9 task-lists/meta
       8 task-lists/dialysis-data
       8 task-lists/datacleanup
       8 task-lists/Nova
       3 task-lists/templates
```
