# December Adventure 2024: Day 24

## MyCmd Project Planning

I have mostly finished the little tasks that could be completed in a single commit. So today I didn't do any coding but took some time to work on my planning document. I made efforts to break down tasks into next actions and to be as ADHD-friendly as possible. Sometimes that next action was simply, "Freewrite about design and goals for Feature X". I'm definitely working on finding strategies and habits to make keeping momentum and progress going.

I pushed [commit 23e2f4adb73fc7ab4835bfd1e7e4b625f195dc53](https://github.com/travisbhartwell/mycmd/commit/23e2f4adb73fc7ab4835bfd1e7e4b625f195dc53) with updates to my [Planning Document](https://github.com/travisbhartwell/mycmd/blob/23e2f4adb73fc7ab4835bfd1e7e4b625f195dc53/docs/mycmd-planning.org?plain=1) with a bit better organization.
