# December Adventure 2024: Day 1

I started out simple today: I updated my static site generator for my development log (based on [booniepepper/dsg-posix-md](https://github.com/booniepepper/dsg-posix-md)) to generate a topic page based on a regex match of the individual generated page lists. I have already pushed this change in [commit 9cb39e0d47d043444725bf0edb37a3414c53d9ee](https://github.com/travisbhartwell/mycmd/commit/9cb39e0d47d043444725bf0edb37a3414c53d9ee). The resulting HTML is a bit ugly, but it works for now. Simple and working is better than complicated and something I will lose momentum doing.

## Other Things to Do

If I have time later today, I want to start by making the start of an Emacs major mode for the Nova language, similar to [nova-vim](https://git.casuallyblue.dev/vega/nova-vim). It has been a long time since I've done a lot of Emacs Lisp coding and I don't know that I've ever written a major mode, so this will be an interesting experiment.
