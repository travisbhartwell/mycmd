# December Adventure 2024

This year, instead of doing [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com), I am going to participate in [December Adventure](https://eli.li/december-adventure).

The idea of December Adventure is simple: pick a project, or projects and work on them a little bit every day in December.

This will be a great way to build momentum on personal projects I am working on.

## My December Adventure Projects

My primary work for December Adventure will be around [MyCmd](https://github.com/travisbhartwell/mycmd/tree/rewrite), including the following ideas:

- Write in this development log about motivations and design choices for MyCmd
- Continue working on the [MyCmd rewrite branch](https://github.com/travisbhartwell/mycmd/tree/rewrite) to get closer to my initial public release. See [this Org-mode file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/travisbhartwell/mycmd/refs/heads/rewrite/docs/mycmd-planning.org) for an on-going list of tasks left.

Additionally, I want to start to understand the rewriting language [Nova](https://wiki.nova-lang.net/index.php?title=Main_Page) and potentially create my own implementation or some other code to understand this very interesting project.
